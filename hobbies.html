    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sports</strong> 💪🏼
        <p>I love sports like football, combat sports (MMA, Boxing, Kick Boxing), and basketball.</p>
        <p>Regarding football, I support the Paris-Saint-Germain team because I am Parisian.</p>

      <li><strong>Traveling</strong> 🌍
        <p>I really enjoy traveling; it's one of my favorite things. This allows you to discover new cultures, places, and ways of living.</p>
        <p>I've traveled to several countries in one year, including Spain, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and the USA.</p>

        <p>I enjoy French rap, and the artists I listen to the most are Booba, Lacrim, and PNL. I'm also attending concerts of American rap artists like Travis Scott and Offset in 2024.</p>
